### Name of Project:
  WorkLife Planner

### Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
  WorkLife Planner is a modular daily/weekly planning app. The user can create reusable timeblocks that are stored in a list, and the user can drag & drop their timeblocks to build out their days. 

  This planner is geared towards illuminating the user's allocation of time between larger (customizable)categories, such as:
    * Work
    * Family
    * Social
    * Study
    * Exercise
    * Hobbies
    * Self-Care
    * Chores and Errands
  
  The planner will provide a reflection of how the user's time is spread across their days or weeks. This will be in the form of a percentage readout of each category. For example: 
    * in a given week, a user can see that 50% of their timeblocks are devoted to work, 30% to family, 10% to self-care, etc.
    * user can set goals for how they want to allocate their time across categories


### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
* user sign in and authentication
* weekly view of the planner
* user can save main list of timeblocks
* user can drag and drop timeblocks into planner to build their day

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* react-dnd
* firebase

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* graphical readout of time allocation (i.e. a pie chart). Can be for the day, week, or both. 
* user can set personal goals for time allocation. e.g. - "I want to spend 15% of my time on self-care"

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* MaterialUI
* ChartJS


### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
